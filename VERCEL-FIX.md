# 🔧 Vercel Deployment Fix

## ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED!

**Problem**: 
```
If `rewrites`, `redirects`, `headers`, `cleanUrls` or `trailingSlash` are used, then `routes` cannot be present.
```

**Solution**: 
✅ **Removed conflicting `vercel.json` configuration**
✅ **Vercel will now auto-detect your static site**

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy Again!

### Your files are now properly configured:
- ✅ `index.html` - Main website file
- ✅ `css/style.css` - All styling
- ✅ `assets/images/` - All images
- ✅ `package.json` - Project metadata
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Clean repository

### No `vercel.json` needed!
Vercel automatically detects static HTML sites and configures them perfectly.

## 🎯 Deploy Now:

### Step 1: Go to Vercel
```
🌐 https://vercel.com
```

### Step 2: Upload Your Folder
```
📁 Drag your entire "Landing Page" folder
🚀 Click "Deploy"
✅ Success!
```

## 🛠️ What Was Fixed:
